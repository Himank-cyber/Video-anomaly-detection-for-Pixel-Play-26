# Future Frame Prediction Based Video Anomaly Detection

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that was made for Pixel Play'26 Video Anomaly Detection Challenge by VLG IITR. 

The primary goal of this project is to:
* Clean the raw dataset
* Build and train a Predictor that can well predict the future frame for normal training data using U-Net architecture
* Add a Generative Adversarial Network module into our framework in light of its success for image generation and video generation
* Build amd train a discriminator network that can identify the abnormal frames generated by the predictor
* Create PSNR scores and save them in CSV file for final submission

## 📂 Data Source
The dataset used in this notebook was obtained from Kaggle challenge of Pixel Play'26 itself.
* **Input:** The data consists of training and testing video frames in .jpg file format. Random training and testing frames are corrupted with noise and vertical flipping is limited to random testing frames only. 
* **Target:** Overlook the corruption is dataset and find anomaly scores for frames

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Prerequisites
To run this notebook, you will need the following Python libraries:
* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* TensorFlow 
* Scipy

## 🚀 How to Run
1.  **Clone the repository:** either clone the repository in your IDE if you are using system resources or paste the notebook code into google colab or kaggle if you are using any of their notebooks
2.  **Install the mentioned Python libraries** (Skip if you are using google colab/ kaggle notebook)
3.  **Update dataset directories in the notebook code**
4.  **Launch the Notebook**

## 📊 Results / Key Findings

**Public Kaggle score achieved:** 0.71897
